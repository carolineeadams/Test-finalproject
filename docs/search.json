    "text": "This analysis examined submissions and comments data from several subreddits and explored the frequency of stocks mentioned in these forums on Reddit. The data analysis involved examining relevant columns, creating new variables, removing rows with zero text length, and identifying and removing columns with missing values. The analysis showed that Meta, Apple, and Netflix were the most frequently mentioned stocks, and Tesla was the most controversial company in the dataset.\nWe analyzed submissions data obtained from the subreddits wallstreetbets, investing, stockmarket, traders, and stocks. The time that the submission was posted, number of comments, upvotes minus downvotes, submission text content, title, and subreddit that the submission came from were essential variables in the data. Only comments that came from posts in wallstreetbets were analyzed due size constraints. Variables of interest for this analysis were the comment text, controversiality score, upvotes minus downvotes, time that the comment was posted, submission id that the comment was associated with, and subreddit that the submission came from.\nAfter examining the data, it was discovered that the posts were made between January 1, 2022 and January 31, 2023. Steps were taken to prepare the data for analysis, such as removing missing values and outliers. A search was implemented to find posts that discussed the stocks of interest, including company names, stock abbreviations, previous company names, and potential misspellings. It was discovered that 2,583 posts used one of the search terms in the body of the post or in the title.\nFinally, the business questions were explored using the prepared data. We found that of “basic girl stocks” in our list, Meta showed up in submissions most frequently, followed by Apple and Netflix. It was also found that Tesla was the most controversial company in the dataset, with 31.6% of comments regarding the company classified as controversial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe submissions data was obtained from the subreddits wallstreetbets, investing, stockmarket, traders, and stocks. The dataset contained 191011 rows. There were multiple columns in the submissions data, although, not all of them were relevant to our analysis. The columns of interest to us were:\n\ncreated_utc: the time that the submission was posted\nnum_comments: the number of comments in response to the submission\nscore: the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes on a submission\nselftext: the submission text content\ntitle: the title of the submission\nsubreddit: the subreddit that the submission came from\n\nSince we obtained data from four different subreddits, we examined how many submissions in our dataset came from each subreddit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe noticed that there were two columns that referenced dates and times: created_utc and retrieved_on. Both of these columns had values in unix time. Unix time is a way of representing a timestamp by representing the time as the number of seconds since January 1st, 1970 at 00:00:00 UTC. We transformed these columns into datetime format in two new columns: created_datetime, and retrieved_datetime. We found that posts in the submissions dataset were posted between January 1, 2022 and January 31, 2023. This applied to the comments data as well, which we discuss further below.\nTo better understand the post text we were working with, we created a variable to represent the length of the submission text and examined summary statistics about the length of the post. The mean number of characters in a submission was approximately 121. The maximum number of characters was 42449 and the minimum was 0. For our analysis, we did not want to include posts in which the text length is equal to zero as this indicates that the post text was missing. Therefore, we dropped all rows where submission_length was equal to 0, which ended up being 63245.\nMissing values are also important to identify and potentially remove from the dataset. Below, we have plotted the number of missing values present in each of the dataset’s columns. As noted earlier, our primary variables of interest were created_utc, num_comments, score, selftext, title, and subreddit. There were no missing values in the primary variables of interest. Four columns had missing values in almost every row. These were: author_flair_css_class, author_flair_text, distinguished, and edited. These are not central to our analysis, and therefore, we decided to fully drop these columns.\n\nTo prepare for the bulk of our exploratory analysis, we implemented a regex search to find posts that discussed the stocks in which we were interested. Our regex included names of the companies of interest (e.g., Netflix), their stock abbreviations (e.g., NFLX), previous company names (e.g., Facebook), and potential misspellings that we anticipated. We also wrote the regex pattern to be case insensitive. In our primary dataframe, we created a new variable to indicate if the Reddit post used one of our search terms. We also filtered the original dataframe to create a new dataframe that only included rows in which the post text or title included one of the search terms. We found that 2583 posts used one of our search terms in the body of the post or in the title.\n\n\n\nDue to the size of the dataset for all comments from all four subreddits, we limited our analysis of comment data to only comments that came from posts in wallstreetbets. All posts from wallstreetbets in our dataset were associated with 15,137,889 comments.\nVariables of interest to our analysis of the comments data included:\n\nbody: the actual comment text\ncontroversiality: whether or not a comment received a similar amount of upvotes to downvotes, hence being controversial\ncreated_utc: the date/time the comment was posted\nlink_id: id of the submission that the comment was posted in response to\nscore: the number of upvotes minus the number of downvotes on a comment\nsubreddit: which subreddit the comment fell under\n\nTo better understand the comment text we were working with, we created a variable to represent the length of the comment text and examined summary statistics about the length as before. The mean number of characters in a comment was approximately 88. The maximum number of characters was 10882 and the minimum was 0. For our analysis, we did not want to include comments in which the text length was equal to zero as this indicates that the body text was missing. Therefore, we dropped all rows where comment_length was equal to 0, which ended up being 125.\nMissing values are also important to identify and potentially remove from the dataset. Below, we have plotted the number of missing values present in each of the comment dataset’s columns. Out of the entire comments dataset, we can see that there were no missing values in the primary variables of interest.\nLike the submissions data, four columns had missing values in almost every row. These were: author_flair_css_class, author_flair_text, distinguished, and edited. These are not central to our analysis, and therefore, we decided to fully drop these columns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore the frequency of “basic girl” stocks mentioned in stock forums on Reddit. Illustrate which are discussed more frequently.\n\nTo start, we calculated how many times each individual stock was mentioned in a post or a post’s title. The search was based on whether the stock ticker or the company name in full was mentioned. We found that Meta showed up in submissions most frequently, followed by Apple, and Netflix. Lululemon was mentioned the least out of this set of stocks.\nBelow, we have plotted the number of posts with our stocks of interest being referenced in either a submission title or text content, by stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn submissions where a “basic girl” stock is mentioned, identify which of those mentioned stocks receive the most comments in general and on average.\n\nWe filtered the data set to only posts that mentioned “basic girl” stocks. We then calculated the average score for posts that discussed each of these stocks and the average number of comments that they received. Submissions that mentioned Pinterest had the highest average score, followed by those that mentioned Lululemon, and finally Ulta. Posts that mentioned Starbucks had the lowest average score out of this set of stocks. Submissions that mentioned Pinterest had the highest number of comments in response on average, followed by those that mentioned Ulta and Meta. Submissions that mentioned Nike had the lowest average number of comments out of this set of stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExamine average score for each “basic girl” stock in terms of controversiality and comments.\n\nTo analyze this, we merged the submissions data for the submissions in which a “basic girl” stock was mentioned with the relevant comments. The dummy variables created for the submissions data were carried over to this merged data frame. We then calculated the average score and average controversiality of the comments associated with submissions that mentioned each of the individual “basic girl” stocks we examined.\nComments on submissions that mentioned Pinterest had the highest degree of controversiality, followed by comments on submissions that mentioned Starbucks. Comments on submissions that mentioned Lululemon had the lowest degree of controversiality. Comments on submissions that mentioned Ulta had the highest average scores, followed by the comments on submissions that mentioned Netflix. Comments on submissions that mentioned Starbucks had the lowest average scores out of this set of stocks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplore how the frequency of “basic girl” stock mentions fluctuate over time.\n\nWe were also interested in examining how the frequency of submissions varied over time. As noted earlier, our dataset had submissions from January 2022 through January 2023. First we plotted the frequency of all submissions in the dataset over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThen we plotted the frequency of submissions using terms related to our “basic” stocks of interest over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plot displaying the frequency of only submissions that mentioned a “basic girl” stock showed that daily number of submissions were generally stable over time. However, there were two clear jumps in number of submissions. The first is seen around February 2022 and the second is seen around May 2022. Interestingly, the second jump in number of daily submissions for this set of posts occurs at the same time that we see a dip in total number of submissions across the studied subreddits in the first plot.\nWe also examined the frequency of daily comment postings in the subreddit over time. Like daily submission frequency, it appears as though daily comment posting frequency is relatively stable over time. We do see the same spike in number of comments in September 2022 that we saw in frequency of all submissions in stock-related subreddits in the submissions dataset.\nNext, we subset the comments dataframe to include only id numbers that matched the id numbers of the posts in the submissions dataset that only included submissions with a mention of a “basic girl” stock. We then examined how posting of comments on these submissions varied over time. The frequency of comment posting on these submissions mirrored the frequency of submission postings seen below for submissions focused on “basic girl” stocks. We see a lot of activity around February and May 2022, as well as September 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLeveraging external stock data, illustrate how the stock prices of “basic girl” stocks fluctuate over time and identify any points where an increase/decrease in frequency of mentions aligns with an increase/decrease in stock price (explored in the previous section).\n\nWe compared stock performance over time to Reddit submission and comment engagement over time. In April 2022, there was a sharp peak in number of in Reddit comments that were associated with submissions that had mentions of “basic” stocks. At the same point, most stocks took a dip in their pricing, most notably Nike. However, this was short lived. In many cases, the stock price quickly reverted back to its original level once market forces took over.\nThere could be some impact however of Reddit discussions on stock prices. When a large number of users on a subreddit discuss a particular stock, it can lead to increased buying or selling pressure, which can affect the stock’s price in the short term. For example, if a large number of Reddit users discuss buying a particular stock, this could lead to increased demand for the stock, which could drive up its price.\nBelow are three visualizations that show the daily adjusted closing price of a selected stock over the years 2019 to 2022. The “basic girl” stocks were divided into sector-based categories, meaning that stocks that were related to each other based on the sector they operate in were grouped together. The reason for grouping the stocks this way was to help the viewer better understand how the stock was performing compared to other potential competitors in the same sector. By grouping the stocks together, it is easier to see the trends and performance of a particular stock relative to other stocks within the same sector. This can help identify patterns, potential correlations, and inform investment decisions. The three visualizations display the stock performance across different sectors, which would allow for direct comparison of the stock’s performance to other stocks within the same sector.\n\n\n\nMedia and Entertainment: Meta, Netflix, Pinterest, and Spotify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFood and Beverage: Starbucks\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRetail: Apple, Etsy, Lululemon, Nike, Peloton, and Ulta"

    "text": "Submissions and comments from the subreddit wallstreetbets were analyzed using natural language processing techniques to gain insights into discussions that Redditors have regarding stocks in general and about specific companies. Natural language processing is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves analyzing large volumes of text data and extracting useful information from it, such as identifying topics, key phrases, and sentiment. We narrowed our analysis to focus mostly on wallstreetbets, as it is the most popular subreddit on the website Reddit that primarily discusses stocks and trading.\nOur main objective was to understand the sentiment of submissions and comments in this forum and the most frequent topics and themes that appeared across popular posts. We were also interested in whether discussions of “basic girl stocks” were prominent on this forum.\nWe filtered down our submissions and comments, identified which discussed the companies that fall under the “basic girl” stock group, and performed basic data checks on our comments such as finding popular words. We then analyzed the sentiment of both posts and comments referencing “basic girl” stocks. Sentiment analysis is the use of computational techniques to automatically identify and classify the emotional tone or attitude expressed in a piece of text, such as positive, negative, or neutral. We found that approximately two-thirds of submissions were identified as having positive sentiment and approximately one-third was identified as having negative sentiment. Very few submissions had neutral sentiment results. Similarly, the overwhelming majority of comments were classified as having either positive or negative sentiment. Very few comments had neutral sentiment. There was a close to equal distribution of comments with positive and negative sentiment, although more comments had a positive sentiment than negative. Our results indicated that for each “basic girl” company, submissions that mentioned that company were mostly positive. For example, Meta and Apple were the two companies mentioned most frequently in the Reddit submissions we examined. About two-thirds of the submissions about these companies had positive sentiment, while about one-third had negative sentiment. We also applied topic modeling to the submissions that mentioned “basic girl” stocks. The analysis on four different groups of text revealed three primary topics. Overall, our analysis provides insights into the sentiment and topics of discussion surrounding “basic girl” stocks on the wallstreetbets subreddit.\n\n\n\nExternal Data\nTo analyze the relationship between the sentiment of Reddit posts and comments and the stock prices of the companies in the “basic girl” stocks list, we used external stock data for the same time frame as the Reddit submissions and comments (2022-2023). We collected the stock data for each company on the list and created a function to pull each stock file and combine the adjusted closing price of all of them into one cohesive data frame. Specifically, the adjusted closing price is the stock’s closing price on a particular day, adjusted for any corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends, and rights offerings that may have occurred before the next day of trading. Combining the adjusted closing prices for all the stocks enabled us to see how the “basic girl” stocks were performing collectively in the market over time. Once the stock data was collected and organized, we merged it with the Reddit data to visualize any potential relationships between the sentiment of Reddit posts and comments and the stock prices of the “basic girl” stocks. By merging the data, we could plot the sentiment scores against the adjusted closing prices to see if there were any patterns or correlations between them. This would allow us to explore if the sentiment expressed in the Reddit posts and comments could potentially impact the stock prices of the “basic girl” stocks.\nFigure 1 below displays the number of submissions and comments made on posts about “basic” stocks by day against average share price for those “basic” stocks for the time period of the provided Reddit data. As seen, there was a peak in discussion about “basic” stocks in Jan-Mar 2022. During the same time period, the average stock price dropped. The submissions and comments then plateaued for the rest of the year as the stock price steadily climbed back up but did not reach the previous price peak.\nFigure 1. Logged Average Share Price of “Basic Stocks” and Number of Submissions/Comments on Relevant Reddit Submissions Over Time\nComment and submission frequency peaked in early 2022\n\nNatural Language Processing Work\nTo begin, we collected all comments posted in the wallstreetbets subreddit group from January 1, 2022 through January 31, 2023, which resulted in a dataset with 15,688,244 rows. To reduce the size of our dataset, we identified the time period during which users were most active in posting submissions and comments on the subreddit, which was February 2022. The majority of comments were generated in the first half of the month, so we filtered the comments to only include those that were posted in the subreddit between February 1 and February 23, 2022, resulting in a total of 942,612 comments. In addition, we also identified all submissions in the wallstreetbets subreddit that mentioned the name or ticker of a “basic girl” company. This resulted in a dataset of slightly less than 2000 submissions. We linked these submissions to their associated comments to generate a limited comments dataset that included slightly over 100,000 comments.\nWe took multiple steps to clean the comments dataframe representing all comments from February 1 through February 23, 2022, including removing stop words. We found that after stop words were removed, there were 428,609 unique words across the comments. See the top 10 words in Figure 2 below.\nFigure 2. Top 10 Terms in Wallstreetbets Subreddit Comments (February 1 - February 23, 2022)\n“Like”, “get”, “market”, “going”, and “money” were the top 5 words across all comments\n\n\n\n\n\nWe then examined the distribution of the lengths of all the comments. Most comments (over 700,000) had under 200 characters. There were some outliers with over 1000 characters. See the distribution of comment lengths below in Figure 3.\nFigure 3. Frequency of Comments by Length\nThe majority of comments had less than 200 characters\n\n\n\n\n\nIn natural language processing, regular expressions (regex) are often used to identify patterns in text data. In this case, we used regex to create dummy variables that would indicate whether certain keywords appeared in the comments we were analyzing. Specifically, we were interested in identifying comments that referenced gender-related terminology, the names of the “basic girl” companies, and common words related to the stock market and trading. By creating dummy variables for each of these categories, we could then use them as predictors in our analysis to see if there was a relationship between these keywords and certain outcomes (e.g., stock price changes, sentiment towards a company). For example, we used a regex pattern to search for any comment that contains words or phrases related to gender (e.g., “boy,” “guy,” “female,” etc.); and if a comment contains any of these keywords, the corresponding dummy variable would be set to 1. We also used regex patterns to search for the names of the “basic girl” companies or common stock market-related words like “shares” or “investor.” Creating these dummy variables using regex allows us to quantify the presence or absence of certain keywords in the comments we are analyzing, which can help us to better understand the nature of the comments and their relationship to the stock market or other relevant outcomes. We found that 27,135 comments had gender related terminology, 34,356 comments had some mention of our “basic” stocks, and 126,070 comments had stock related terminology.\nWe also applied TF-IDF weighting to the submissions and comments. TF-IDF weighting is a technique used in information retrieval and text mining to assess the importance of each term in a document. Each Reddit post or comment represents a document. TF-IDF values are calculated by multiplying the term frequency (TF) of the term in the document by the inverse document frequency (IDF) of the term in the corpus. Higher TF-IDF values indicate that the term is more significant to the document and less common in the corpus, and vice versa for lower values. By applying TF-IDF weighting to the submissions and comments, we are able to identify the most important terms within each document (i.e., each Reddit post or comment) relative to the entire corpus of documents. Terms with higher TF-IDF scores are considered more important to the document, and are often used as keywords or features in natural language processing applications like text classification or sentiment analysis, which will be done below. We found that the terms with the highest TF-IDF values were “nispe”, “rabble”, “beo”, “mqa”, and “imagery” (Figure 4).\nFigure 4. Top 10 Terms in Wallstreetbets Subreddit Comments with Highest TF-IDF Values (February 1 - February 23, 2022)\nThe words with highest TF-IDF values did not provide useful information for our analysis\n\n\n\n\n\nSentiment Model\nIn this context, sentiment analysis refers to the process of using computational techniques to identify the emotional tone or attitude expressed in posts and comments related to “basic girl” stocks. This process was useful in helping answer Business Question #7: Analyze the general sentiment of posts that mention “basic girl stocks”, and examine whether the different stocks have varying sentiments and Business Question #8: Explore which type of posts (positive, negative, or neutral) receive the most engagement, and determine if sentiment impacts the price of a specific stock.\nSentiment modeling involves analyzing the language and context of the text to determine whether the sentiment expressed is positive, negative, or neutral. The sentiment analysis was done to gain insights into how people were talking about the stocks and to understand how this sentiment might be related to the stock prices. By classifying the sentiment of the posts and comments as positive, negative, or neutral, the researchers were able to identify whether there were any patterns or trends in the sentiment over time. For example, if there were many positive posts and comments about a particular stock, it might suggest that there was a positive sentiment surrounding the stock, which could potentially be reflected in the stock price. Conversely, if there were many negative posts and comments about a stock, it might suggest that there was a negative sentiment surrounding the stock, which could potentially lead to a decline in the stock price. We used the SparkNLP sentiment analysis tools to develop a pipeline that pulled in our documents and analyzed the sentiment of each comment, providing a resulting positive/negative/neutral.\nWhen looking at submissions, approximately two-thirds of the posts were identified as having positive sentiment and approximately one-third was identified as having negative sentiment. Very few submissions had neutral sentiment results (Figure 5).\nFigure 5. Sentiment Analysis by Basic Girl Stock\nSubmissions generally lean positive for basic girl stocks\n\n\n\n\n\nWe found that positive submissions had, on average, almost three times the number of comments of negative submissions. Negative submissions had slightly higher scores (Table 1).\nTable 1. Effect of Sentiment on Submission Engagement\nPositive submissions had more comments than and a similar score to negative submissions\n\n\n\n\n\nOur results indicated that for each “basic girl” company, submissions that mentioned that company were mostly positive (Table 2). For example, Meta and Apple were the two companies mentioned most frequently in the Reddit submissions we examined. About two-third of the submissions about these companies had positive sentiment, while about one-third had negative sentiment. \nTable 2. Number of Comments by Sentiment Type and Type of “Basic Girl” Stock Mentioned in the Parent Submission\nLululemon had the highest proportion of positive comments, followed by tech stocks\n\nAverage degrees of positivity were calculated for all submissions and cross tabulated by “basic girl” company mentioned (Table 3). Positivity scores close to 1 were the highest, and positivity scores close to 0 represented strong negativity.\nTable 3. Effect of Sentiment on Submission Engagement by “Basic Girl” Stock Mentioned\nSubmissions that discussed stocks with the highest average share price had higher degrees of positivity, on average\n\nSubmissions that mentioned each “basic girl” stock had a high average degree of positivity, with the exception of Starbucks, which had a score that indicated that these submissions on average were more negative than positive. Submissions that mentioned Lululemon had the highest average degree of positivity, followed by those associated with submissions that discussed Spotify, Meta, and Peloton. We see a weak positive relationship between degree of positivity of comments by “basic girl” company mentioned in the parent submission and average stock price (Table 3). For example, the two companies with the lowest average share prices, Peloton and Pinterest, had some of the lowest degrees of positivity, and Lululemon and Netflix had higher average share prices and higher degrees of positivity. Ulta is an outlier; the parent company had a high share price but comments on posts discussing this company had on average a mid-tier degree of positivity.\nLinked [here] is the code for the sentiment analyses and visualizations.\nTopic Modeling\nWe also used topic modeling in our research. This helped us answer Business Question #6: For submissions where a “basic girl stock” is mentioned and we see large numbers of comments, identify what topics and themes are prominent in those discussions. Topic modeling is a technique used to identify the underlying topics or themes in a large corpus of text data. It is a type of unsupervised learning, meaning that it does not require any pre-existing labels or categories to be assigned to the data. Instead, it uses statistical methods to group together words that tend to co-occur frequently within documents, and then assigns these groups of words to topics. We applied topic modeling to the submissions that mentioned “basic girl” stocks in order to identify the most common topics or themes that were being discussed in relation to these stocks on the wallstreetbets subreddit. Overall, topic modeling provides a useful way to gain insights into the underlying themes and topics that are being discussed in a large corpus of text data, and can help to identify trends or patterns that may not be immediately apparent from a manual review of the data.\nWe applied topic modeling to four different groups of text to identify overall themes in specific discussions, understand variation in themes across these text groupings, and see if the generated themes were similar to the topics of interest to us (discussions of gender, the stock market generally, or the “basic girl” companies). These topics of interest were identified in the submissions or comments text by conducting regex searches to find relevant words and creating dummy variables to identify posts that included those relevant words. The text groupings used for topic modeling were 1) submissions that mentioned “basic girl” stocks, 2) all comments on those submissions, 3) comments on those submissions that included direct references to gender-, stock market-, or “basic girl” company-related terms, and 4) all comments during the busiest time on the wallstreetbets subreddit (February 1 through February 23, 2022) that included direct references to gender-, stock market-, or “basic girl” company-related terms. Four topics were generated for each text grouping (Table 4).\nThe topics generated for submissions that mentioned “basic girl” stocks included terms representing “basic girl” companies like Netflix and Meta (Facebook), as well as terms describing success, holding stocks, and the Metaverse. Topics for the comments on these submissions also focused on the company, Meta, but differed from the topics generated for the submissions in that they included more terms related to bots, money, and the stock market more broadly.\nWhen comments were limited to those that included a gender-, stock-market-, or “basic girl” company-related term, generated topics narrowed in on inflation, the market, and the Fed, buying and selling stocks, and companies like Facebook and Apple. These topics were present for the comments examined in February 2022 and for all comments associated with posts that discussed “basic girl” stocks. This makes sense as we had narrowed in on comments that discussed stock market terms and “basic girl company” mentions. Both translated into the generated topics. However, we did not see topics generated related to gendered terms. Lastly, the focus on the Fed, inflation, and the market in the topics generated for the subset of comments from February 1 through February 23, 2022, made sense, as this was around the time that the Russian invasion of Ukraine resulted in global inflation and a market crash.\nTable 4. Topics Generated from Topic Modeling and Derived from Top Words\nRecurring themes included the stock market, generally, successful companies and the Metaverse, and the Fed and inflation\n\n\n\n\n\nLinked [here] is the code for the topic modeling analyses and visualizations."

    "text": "Conclusion\nThis project explored how often four subreddits (wallstreetbets, investing, stock, traders) received submissions that mentioned “basic girl stocks.” It also explored general themes across, sentiment of, and engagement with these posts, using natural language processing techniques. We were interested in how submissions and comments in these forums discuss these “basic girl” stocks and how submission and comment engagement scores, sentiment, and discussion content vary when posts discuss “basic girl” stocks versus other stocks or topics.\nWe found that the daily number of submissions and that mention a “basic girl stock” and associated comments were generally stable over time. We then examined the distribution of the lengths of all the comments. Most comments (over 700,000) had under 200 characters. There were some outliers with over 1000 characters. We used the SparkNLP sentiment analysis tools to develop a pipeline that pulled in our documents and analyzed the sentiment of each comment, providing a resulting positive/negative/neutral. When looking at submissions, approximately two-thirds of the posts were identified as having positive sentiment and approximately one-third was identified as having negative sentiment. Very few submissions had neutral sentiment results. Similarly, the overwhelming majority of comments were classified as having either positive or negative sentiment. Very few comments had neutral sentiment.\nWe applied topic modeling to four different groups of text to identify overall themes in specific discussions. The topics generated for submissions that mentioned “basic girl” stocks included terms representing “basic girl” companies like Netflix and Meta (Facebook), as well as terms describing success, holding stocks, and the Metaverse. Topics for the comments on these submissions also focused on the company, Meta, but differed from the topics generated for the submissions in that they included more terms related to bots, money, and the stock market more broadly.\nThe machine learning aspect of this project gave us some insight into working with stock data, as stock discussions can be incredibly volatile and can shift focus quickly and without warning as stock market news spreads. The machine learning aspect of this project highlighted the challenges in making accurate predictions about Reddit submissions that discuss “basic girl” stocks. The varying sentiments associated with different types of submissions, coupled with the similarity in engagement metrics across submissions that mentioned the different stocks, made it difficult to create models that performed better than random guessing.\n\nNext Steps\nInsights gained from these analyses can inform future research and modeling efforts in this field. With more time, we would attempt more machine learning models and employ additional hyperparameter tuning steps in an effort to increase prediction accuracy. We would also explore text prediction methods to see if the submission and comment content could aid in predicting information about the submissions and comments. Lastly, we would expand on our natural language processing work by creating additional interesting visuals like word clouds to better display our findings."

    "text": "Our machine learning analysis provided insights into working with volatile stock data. The logistic regression and random forest algorithms yielded an accuracy score of 84%, suggesting that variables like comment score, controversiality, length, and sentiment were helpful predictors of a post’s associated stock. However, the data was unbalanced, possibly influencing the high accuracy score. The first two modeling exercises were not promising, with little predictiveness found in submissions or comments. Overall, predicting sentiment in Reddit submissions discussing “basic girl” stocks is difficult due to varying sentiments and similar engagement metrics. These insights can inform future research in this field.\n\n\n\n\nExplore whether or not we can predict the sentiment of a submission based on engagement of the post and the stock associated with it.\n\nModel 1: Predicting Submission Sentiment from Information on Post Engagement, Comments, Types of Stocks Mentioned in the Post, and Stock Prices\nInitially, we aimed to “explore whether or not we can predict stock price directionality based on submission and comment data from Reddit”. However, after further diving into our data we realized this was unfeasible. The data on Reddit is user-generated content and may contain inaccurate or biased information. Meanwhile, the stock market is influenced by a wide range of factors, including economic indicators, geopolitical events, and company news, making it difficult to isolate the impact of Reddit data on stock price directionality. Due to this, even if there is some correlation it may be difficult to identify and quantify, which makes this a difficult model to build and trust with the data we have.\nInstead, we have decided to leverage our data on submissions and the associated stock types to predict the sentiment of each submission as we believe this will be more relevant. By analyzing engagement, we can gain valuable insights into consumer sentiment and preferences, particularly in the “basic girl” demographic. This will help us better understand which types of submissions are likely to generate positive responses and how to communicate about certain stocks in a way that will capture the attention of this audience.\nWe generated a machine learning pipeline using PySpark to perform binary classification on the set of Reddit submissions that mentioned at least one “basic girl” stock in the post text or the title. The dataset contained features such as ‘score,’ ‘num_comments,’ and ‘submission_length,’ and binary indicator variables for companies such as ‘lululemon’ and ‘apple.’ The dummy variables indicated if a given basic stock was mentioned in the submission. If a given basic stock was mentioned in the submission, we also included the share price of that stock at the time that the submission was posted as a predictor. For days when the stock market was closed, the average share price of the stock over the entire time period (January 2022 through January 2023) was imputed. The goal of the pipeline was to predict whether a given piece of text had a positive or negative sentiment, which was generated in our natural language processing module of the project.\nThe pipeline consisted of several stages, and we used this pipeline process for both of our models (see second model below). First, the text sentiment was converted from a string to a numeric index using the StringIndexer function. Next, the features were assembled into a vector using the VectorAssembler function. Two machine learning models were then defined: logistic regression and random forest. The models were then evaluated using k-fold cross-validation and grid search to determine the best set of hyperparameters. This step was included in our comprehensive pipeline to address the extra credit prompt. The logistic regression model was trained with a regularization parameter c of either 0.01 or 0.1, while the random forest model was trained with a different number of trees and maximum depth parameters. Finally, the best models were used to predict sentiment on a test dataset, and their performance was evaluated using the BinaryClassificationEvaluator function, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) being used as the primary metric. Other metrics were also evaluated for both models to better understand overall performance. Eighty percent of the data was used for training, eighteen percent was used for testing, and two percent was set aside for prediction efforts.\nThe evaluation results below demonstrated the performance of the logistic regression and random forest models on the test dataset. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model. The false negative rate for both models was quite high, with 98 instances being classified as negative when they should have been positive for the logistic regression model and 91 for the random forest. Both models had much lower false positive rates, with one instance being classified as positive when it should have been negative for the logistic regression model and 8 for the random forest model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accuracy for both models was the same at 0.669, indicating that they correctly predicted sentiment in roughly two-thirds of the cases. However, the AUC score for the logistic regression model was only slightly above chance at 0.506, while the AUC score for the random forest model was marginally higher at 0.52. AUC is a metric that measures the overall performance of a binary classifier by plotting the true positive rate against the false positive rate, and a score of 0.5 indicates random guessing. Thus, the AUC scores suggest that both models performed only slightly better than random guessing.\nThe precision score measures the proportion of predicted positive instances that are actually positive. In contrast, the recall score measures the proportion of true positive instances that are correctly predicted as positive. The precision score for the random forest model was 0.47, meaning that roughly half of the instances classified as positive were actually positive. The recall score for both models was low, indicating that a small proportion of true positive instances were correctly classified as positive. Finally, the F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and it was only available for the random forest model, with a value of 0.124. Overall, the results suggest that the models did not perform particularly well at predicting sentiment. \nThe ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve is a graphical representation of the performance of a binary classifier at different classification thresholds. The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. \nROC curves were plotted for both the random forest and the logistic regression models. These are shown below. We can see that for both, the ROC curve hovered around 0.5, which means that the model did not perform better than random guessing. This is because the area under the ROC curve (AUC) for a model that performs no better than random guessing is 0.5. Therefore, an AUC score close to 0.5 suggests that the model is not performing well in distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n[LINK] - Model 1 Code\nModel 2: Predicting Comment Sentiment from Information on Comment Length, Score, and Controversiality\nWe narrowed the comments down to those during which users were most active in posting submissions and comments on the subreddit, which was February 2022. Most comments were generated in the first half of the month, so we filtered the comments only to include those posted in the subreddit between February 1 and February 23, 2022, resulting in a total of 942,612 comments. The dataset contained the features ‘score,’ ‘controversiality,’ and ‘comment_length.’ The goal of the pipeline was to predict whether a given comment had a positive or negative sentiment based on those features, which was generated in our natural language processing module of the project.\nThe evaluation results below demonstrated the performance of the logistic regression and random forest models on the test dataset. The confusion matrix shows the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives for each model. The false negative rate for both models was again relatively high, with 149,936 instances being classified as negative when they should have been positive for the logistic regression model and 104,335 for the random forest. Both models had much lower false positive rates, with six instances being classified as positive when they should have been negative for the logistic regression model and 34,301 for the random forest model. The logistic regression model had a much lower false positive rate than the random forest model.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe accuracy for both models was similar, with the logistic regression model having a slightly worse accuracy than the random forest model (0.523 and 0.559, respectively). The scores indicate they correctly predicted sentiment in over half of the cases. However, the AUC score for the random forest model was the highest of any machine learning model types used in this analysis, despite it being only slightly above chance at 0.589. In contrast, the AUC score for the logistic regression model was a little lower at 0.53. Again, the AUC scores suggest that both models performed only slightly better than random guessing.\nThe logistic regression model had a high precision score of 0.714, meaning that about seventy percent of the instances classified as positive were actually positive. The recall score for the random forest model was lower at 0.571. The random forest model had a better F1 score (0.397) than the logistic regression model (0), although both models generally had very low F1 scores. Similar to model 1, the results from this analysis suggest that the models did not perform particularly well at predicting comment sentiment.\nLastly, ROC curves were plotted for both the random forest and the logistic regression models. These are shown below. We can see that for both, the ROC curve hovered around or slightly above 0.5, which means that the models were not performing better than random guessing. Therefore, an AUC score of 0.5 suggests that the model is not performing well in distinguishing between the positive and negative classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n[LINK] - Model 2 Code\n\nPredict the industry of the stock being discussed in a submission based on data related to the submission and its comments, such as keywords, sentiment, and context.\nModel 3: Predicting the Sector of the Stock Based on Comment Length, Comment Score, Controversiality, and Sentiment\nInitially, we had questioned “how can we use machine learning algorithms to predict which stocks are likely to be discussed more frequently on stock subreddits in the near future”. One of the main issues we found with this question is the limited predictive power. Even with the most advanced machine learning algorithms, it would be difficult to accurately predict which stocks would be discussed more frequently on subreddits in the near future, as social media activity is influenced by a wide range of factors that can be difficult to quantify.\nAlso, based on the data we had and the analysis we did in NLP, we felt that there could be a more interesting analysis related to the sentiment data and the impacts of the industry of the stocks. For one, knowing the industry of the stock being discussed in a submission can help businesses target their marketing efforts more effectively, by tailoring their messaging and offerings to specific customer segments and understanding consumer behavior by industry better. Also, understanding the industry of the stock being discussed in a submission can help businesses manage risk more effectively, by identifying potential threats and opportunities in the market.\nWe generated a machine learning pipeline using PySpark to perform a binary classification on a data set of Reddit comments that were associated with a submission that mentioned at least one “basic girl” stock in the post text or the title. The data set contained features such as ‘score,’ ‘controversiality,’ and ‘comment_length,’ and binary indicator variables for each company’s presence. The dummy variables indicated if a given basic stock was mentioned in the submission. The goal of the model was to predict the industry of the stock discussed in a given comment. We identified the sectors as tech, retail, and food & beverage; and each stock was only given one categorization.\nOne of the main issues in this dataset was the imbalanced classes. The positive class (sector was mentioned, in this use case looking at retail) was only 15.37% of the total observations, making the negative class about 85%. To address this, we looking into oversampling the smaller class or undersampling the larger class, such as processes like SMOTE. However at this time we did not feel this aptly applied to our problem, and it negatively affected our models when run. For future work, this could be something to look into more deeply.\nThe evaluation results demonstrated that the performance of the logistic regression and random forest models was exactly the same on the test dataset. The false negative rate for both models was high, with 2,665 observations being classified as negative when they should have been positive. Neither model predicted that any observations were positive, and therefore, had true positive and false positive rates of zero.\nThe accuracy for both models was the same at 0.847, which was the highest accuracy we achieved from any algorithm applied to our three modeling exercises. The scores indicate the models correctly predicted if a comment was connected to a post that discussed a retail company stock or not in the majority of the cases. However, the AUC scores were still low at 0.512. The AUC scores suggest that both models performed only slightly better than chance at guessing in terms of distinguishing between the two classes. Because the models did not predict any of the positive class, neither one had a precision or F1 score. In addition, both models had recall values of zero.\n\nROC curves were plotted for both the logistic regression and the random forest models, as shown below. It is evident that both models performed poorly since the ROC curve is close to 0.5, indicating that the model’s performance is no better than random guessing. An area under the ROC curve (AUC) score of 0.5 is typical for a model that performs no better than random guessing. Hence, a score close to 0.5 suggests that the model cannot differentiate well between the positive and negative classes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[LINK] - Model 3 Code\n\n\nThe most accurate model of all modeling exercises was identified to be the random forest model from the third modeling exercise. This model was saved to our s3 bucket from the “ml_3.ipynb” notebook where the model was generated and reloaded into the notebook called “s3_predictions.ipynb” in our code/ml directory. This process demonstrated that we were successfully able to save a model and reload it to make predictions on new data without completing any additional training.\n[LINK] to S3 Notebook\n\n\n\n\nThe machine learning aspect of this project provided valuable insights into working with stock data. Stock discussions can be incredibly volatile and can shift focus quickly and without warning as stock market news spreads. Out of the three models constructed for this segment of the project, the logistic regression and random forest algorithms from the third modeling analysis yielded the highest accuracy score at 84%. This suggests that variables such as comment score, controversiality, length of comments, and sentiment were helpful predictors of a post’s associated stock. However, we also discovered that the data was slightly unbalanced, with one class having more observations associated with it than the other. This could have influenced the high accuracy score, as the models ended up predicting only the negative class to achieve this score. Future adjustments could be made to rebalance the classes to achieve better modeling results.\nHowever, the first two modeling exercises did not yield promising results. Our analysis of Reddit submissions that mentioned “basic girl” stocks revealed that information on a submission’s score and number of comments, as well as information on which stocks were mentioned in the submission and their corresponding share price, were not very predictive of a submission’s sentiment. Similarly, our analysis of comments taken from the subreddit wallstreetbets in February 2022 showed that information about the comments, including length, score, and controversiality, were only slightly more predictive of a comment’s sentiment than chance.\nIn conclusion, analyzing these business questions highlighted the challenges in making accurate predictions about Reddit submissions that discuss “basic girl” stocks. The varying sentiments associated with stocks, coupled with the similarity in engagement metrics, make it difficult to create models that perform better than random guessing. However, the insights gained from these analyses can inform future research and modeling efforts in this field."

    "text": "Summary\n“Basic girl” stocks typically refer to companies that cater to the interests and consumption habits of a certain demographic group, specifically young women who may be interested in fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products. These types of companies are often popular and widely recognized among consumers, which makes them interesting to study from an investment perspective. Investors often look for opportunities to invest in companies that have strong brand recognition and a loyal customer base. These companies often have a large and dedicated customer base that is willing to spend money on their products, which can lead to consistent revenue growth and profitability. Basic girl stocks often operate in the consumer discretionary sector, which can be sensitive to changes in consumer behavior and trends. This can make them a good barometer for overall consumer sentiment and provide insights into broader economic trends.\nDiscussions in subreddits about stocks or investing can provide insights into market sentiment about specific companies or sectors. By monitoring these discussions, investors can gain a better understanding of how other investors perceive certain stocks, and potentially adjust their own investment strategies accordingly. These discussions may also provide information about industry news and trends related to basic girl stocks, such as new product launches, changing consumer preferences, or evolving market conditions. By studying basic girl stocks, investors can gain a better understanding of the overall health of the consumer discretionary sector and make informed investment decisions based on this information. Basic girl stocks can be interesting to study from an investment perspective due to their popularity among consumers, potential for consistent growth, and insights into broader economic trends.\nCompanies like Apple, Netflix, and Starbucks benefit from the brand recognition that members of a higher social class, with disposable income, provide. (Source: https://wakemag.org/voices/2022/2/21/the-white-girl-index) For this project, we define “basic girl” stocks as the following: Apple (AAPL), Etsy (ETSY), Lululemon (LULU), Facebook (META), Netflix (NFLX), Nike (NKE), Pinterest (PINS), Peloton (PTON), Starbucks (SBUX), Spotify (SPOT), and Ulta (ULTA).\nThis analysis examined how often four subreddits (wallstreetbets, investing, stock, traders) received submissions and explored general themes across, sentiment of, and engagement with these posts, using natural language processing techniques. The average share price, average number of submissions, and average number of comments for the collection of basic girl stocks is seen below in Figure 1. Note that the y-axis has been logged to make it easier to visually compare and analyze the data, and as a result, the y-axis values are no longer directly proportional to the original data. There was a peak in discussion about “basic” stocks in January - March 2022, during which time the average stock price of those companies dropped. The submissions and comments then plateaued for the rest of the year as the stock price steadily climbed back up but never reached the previous price.\n\nSources: Yahoo Finance (share price data) and Pushshift Reddit archive (submissions and comments data).\nThis project also leveraged machine learning and external stock price data to identify patterns in Reddit submissions that could be used to predict information about stocks such as future stock prices. We were interested in how submissions and comments in these forums discussed these “basic girl” stocks and how submission and comment engagement scores, sentiment, and discussion content varied when posts discussed “basic girl” stocks versus other stocks."

Illustrate which are discussed more frequently.\nTechnical Proposal: Filter reddit data to top stock-related subreddits (investing, wallstreetbets, stockmarket, traders, stocks). Create a dictionary of stocks that fall into this category, and use regex expressions to locate every reddit submission from these subreddits that mentions these stocks. Identify how often these stocks are mentioned by producing statistics related to the proportion of posts in a month that discuss these stocks in relation to the total number of submissions in these stocks in that month. Clearly state what average percentage of submissions mention these stocks in a given month. To identify which of these stocks are mentioned at higher rates than others, we’ll sort counts.\n\n\n2. In submissions where a “basic girl” stock is mentioned, identify which of those mentioned stocks receive the most comments, on average.\nTechnical Proposal: Filter the submissions, then categorize the submissions by the mentioned stock and count the number of comments for each stock. Compute the average comment count for each stock and present the results in a data frame sorted in descending order. This analysis will help identify the stocks that generate the highest average comment count and determine which “basic girl” stocks are receiving the most engagement.\n\n\n3. Examine average score for each “basic girl” stock in terms of controversiality and comments.\nTechnical Proposal: Filter the submissions, then categorize the submissions by the mentioned stock and collect the submission score for each submission. Average these submission scores for each stock and display the results in a data frame. This analysis can help make conclusions about which “basic girl” stocks are producing higher average submission scores.\n\n\n4. Explore how the frequency of “basic girl” stock mentions fluctuate over time.\nTechnical Proposal: Create a plot to examine the frequency of these stocks appearing in discussion over time. This plot will help to identify trends in frequencies and understand potential links between spikes in discussions and current events surrounding those stocks. Also, provide a comparison between the fluctuation in the submissions of interest versus all submissions in the subreddits of interest in the form of a plot over time.\n\n\n5. Leveraging external stock data, illustrate how the stock prices of “basic girl” stocks fluctuate over time and identify any points where an increase/decrease in frequency of mentions aligns with an increase/decrease in stock price.\nTechnical Proposal: Collect stock data regarding the identified “basic girl” stocks and create a time series plot to examine the fluctuation of stock prices over time. The reddit data also includes month and year of submission variables, so compare the frequency of submissions versus stock prices. This will allow us to compare stock trends to the discussions of these stocks in the subreddits. The two trends will give insight into whether or not stock prices might influence the amount of discussions occurring at a given point in time."

Extract text from the Reddit posts and use the pretrained Spark NLP John Snow Labs Sentiment Classifier to classify sentiment of submission text after data cleaning - namely removing stop words and punctuation. Group the sentiment by stock to visualize the distribution of positive, negative, and neutral sentiments for each stock.\n\n\n8. Explore which type of posts (positive, negative, or neutral) receive the most engagement, and determine if sentiment impacts the price of a specific stock.\nTechnical Proposal: Group the submissions by sentiment; then, average the number of comments across submissions in each sentiment category. Display these averages in a data frame to determine which sentiment receives the highest engagement (based on number of comments). Then, using the external stock price data from a single point in time, examine potential correlations between positive/negative/neutral classification and high/low stock price, if any."
